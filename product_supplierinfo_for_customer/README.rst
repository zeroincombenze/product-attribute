Use product supplier info also for customers
============================================

This modules allows to use supplier info structure, available in
*Procurements* tab of the product form, also for defining customer information,
allowing to define prices per customer and product.

Installation
------------




Configuration
-------------





For these prices to be used in sale prices calculations, you will have
to create a pricelist with a rule with option "Based on" with the value
"Supplier prices on the product form" (although the text is not clear enough).

Usage
-----








=====

There's a new section on *Sales* tab of the product form called "Customers",
where you can define records for customers with the same structure of the
suppliers.

The product code / product name specified for the customer can be reflected
on the sale orders using module `product_supplierinfo_for_customer_sale
<https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/tree/8.0/product_supplierinfo_for_customer_sale>`_

Known issues / Roadmap
----------------------





* Product prices through this method are only guaranteed on the standard sale
  order workflow. Other custom flows maybe don't reflect the price.
* The minimum quantity will not also be applied on sale orders.
* Computed fields in product.supplierinfo object won't properly work for
  customer type
